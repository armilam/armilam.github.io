It is my mission to grow software teams at both a team and an individual level.

I believe that teams work best when they have clarity and alignment. By working on those two things, we can build the trust needed to work together smoothly and with confidence that we are working on the same goals.

I believe that people do their best work when they operate with a growth mindset. We can all learn from each other as long as we keep our minds open to it. As a leader, it is on me to realize that I can learn from those around me just as much as I hope they can learn from me.

I grew up as a software engineer with a focus on the architecture. I think in systems and work to make those systems work well together and work for the people interacting with them. I apply this kind of thinking in both technical and non-technical domains.
