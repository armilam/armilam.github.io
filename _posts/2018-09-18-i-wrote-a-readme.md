Some people call them Manager Readmes. I'm calling mine simply, README. It's about me. As a manager, as a coworker, as a direct report, as a human. You can read it right [here]({% link self-readme.md %}).

I believe this README can be helpful to those I work with, but more importantly it is helpful to me for introspection. As I wrote that page, it forced me to think about what I am like. It forced me to think about how I can be a better person and coworker.

I plan to update my README frequently when I think about it. Hopefully I will update it when I find something new to focus on improving about myself. Hopefully I will update it when I have done enough to improve in areas that I don't think I need to focus on them anymore.

So feel free to read my README. You don't have to if you don't want to. But I welcome your feedback!
