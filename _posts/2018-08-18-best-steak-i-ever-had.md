Just the other day, I ate the best steak I've ever had. It was a $10 ribeye I made myself using a sous-vide cooker. I seasoned it with salt, pepper, and rosemary, vacuum sealed it and froze it when I bought the meat. I took it right from the freezer and cooked at 132.5Â° for about and hour and a half before grilling it at high heat for a couple minutes on each side. Paired with a sweet potato with red onion, it was an amazing meal.

Yep, that's all this post is about, but I felt it was important to share.
