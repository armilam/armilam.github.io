I began my programming career in JavaScript, which quickly transformed into a love for Java back in its 1.1 days. My education consisted of C++ and Java, but I always wanted to know what else was out there. I taught myself C and little bit of Assembler. I learned Scheme and Prolog. I used Notepad as my main code editor.

Then I learned C# and I learned to love Visual Studio. Microsoft technologies became my main focus. MSSQL, ASP.NET, and the like. Since then I've delved into various projects in Perl, Oracle, JScript, ActionScript, Ruby, and more. I've found myself in a position where I'll be working with all the latest and greatest and not-so-great programming technologies. I am a software engineer at a medium-sized software consulting company.

This blog is to be all about what I learn on and off the job so that all can learn from my mistakes and successes. Feel free to comment on my posts. Hopefully I'll learn just as much information as I post here.
