I wrote a blog post.

And now I'm expanding it.

It's easier than it seems, at first, to start a blog.

So many of you out there think "I should write a blog." But then you think "it's so much work - and the commitment! Oy!"

I thought that, too. But then I realized there was no commitment.

Have you seen my posting history? I've written just 26 posts in four years! What is that, a post a month? But you know what? Some of the stuff I wrote was useful to _somebody_. Heck, some of it was useful to _me_ later on when I needed to recall a how-to I wrote a year or two before.

So for those of you who are stuck on the potential commitment of keeping up a blog, stop it! A blog doesn't become a commitment until you get a large reader base that expects regular updates. You are not [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) (yet).

Instead, do what I'm doing. I write when I happen to have something to write about. I try something new, I write about it. I solve some problem I've been having that others might also have, I write about it. The company I work at hands out topics and motivates me with prizes, I write.

Writing a blog is not a commitment. It's more a blessing than anything. Future you will thank you for documenting your experiences. And maybe some other people, too. So why aren't you writing?

There, that wasn't so bad.

_This post is part of a weekly [Blog Battle](http://swanson.github.com/blog/2011/10/13/sep-blog-off.html)-turned-tournament started by some of my coworkers. Each week, bloggers are matched up based on the tourney bracket and a random topic/title is chosen for each match. The bloggers get to interpret the title however they wish. My [SEPeers](http://www.sep.com/) get to vote for the winner and the champion is, well... the champion!_
