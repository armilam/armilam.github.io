With great pleasure (and with slight tardiness), I would like to announce the formation of [GDG Indy](https://plus.google.com/109630468411478574147)! Google Developer Groups allow developers to get together to learn and talk about Google-related technologies.

I teamed up with [Vince Kennedy](https://twitter.com/VKennedy85) of DeveloperTown a couple of months ago to upgrade the former Android Developers Group to an official GDG chapter. [DeveloperTown](http://www.developertown.com/) is kind enough to host us for now. If the chapter grows big enough, we will need to look for a bigger space.

Because of the chapter's roots, we are beginning with Android-heavy content. We started with a talk on Android Fragments, our next talk will be on Material Design, and we have a few more Android-related talks in the works. And, of course, we will always accept suggestions for topics. Additionally, if you or someone you know would like to give a talk on a Google-related topic, we would love to hear from you!

Find us on [Meetup.com](http://www.meetup.com/indy-gdg/), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/109630468411478574147), and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GDGIndy).
