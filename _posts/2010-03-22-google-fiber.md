I am officially showing my support for Google Fiber in [Carmel, Indiana](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmel,_Indiana). To anyone living in Carmel, it should be clear why we deserve Google Fiber:

Carmel is a thriving city on the north side of Indianapolis. It is growing at an incredible rate. Business growth is encouraged by the local government, and there is no end in sight. The new [Carmel City Center](http://www.carmelcitycenter.com/) is an excellent example of this.

Carmel has an incredible sense of community with the many [parks](http://www.carmelclayparks.com/), the [Arts and Design District](http://www.carmelartsanddesign.com/), and the many [trails](http://www.indianatrails.com/content/carmel-trail-system) throughout the city. On top of all of that, Hamilton County (where Carmel is located) was recently named [the best county in the US to raise a family](http://www.forbes.com/2008/06/27/schools-places-family-forbeslife-cx_zg_0630realestate_slide_21.html?thisspeed=25000) by Forbes magazine.

With all of this growth, the need for broadband internet service continues to increase. As a tech-savvy city full of business and community, Google Fiber would be a huge benefit.

If you agree with me (or if you want to support your own city), go [here](http://www.google.com/appserve/fiberrfi/public/options) to fill out Google's RFI. Feel free to include a link to this blog post in the RFI if you don't really feel up to typing out a whole lot.

Also, if I've left out any important information about Carmel, leave a comment and I'll add to this post.
