Hey all! I've made an awesome pivot in my career. I've moved away from the custom software shop model of [SEP](http://www.sep.com) and into the startup world with [Lessonly](https://www.lessonly.com) - "the dead simple training software".

What an awesome place to work! I'm the Lead Engineer, which means I'm developing every new thing in the web application. I'm doing stuff like leading internal product discovery sessions, tweaking the visual design, adding new features, fixing bugs, testing it all, and working with [an amazing team](https://www.lessonly.com/team/). Seriously, I couldn't be happier.

Because of this change, I've switched focus from Android and iOS development to Ruby on Rails. It's a change, for sure, but I'm doing my best not to lose my connection to mobile dev. I'm working on apps in my spare time as well as co-running [GDG Indy](/2014/07/30/announcing-gdg-indy.html) ([join us!](http://www.meetup.com/indy-gdg/)).
